## ðŸ§  What is the `final` Keyword?

In Java, the `final` keyword is a **non-access modifier** that is used to **restrict modification**. Once something is declared `final`, it **cannot be changed** in the way thatâ€™s restrictedâ€”whether it's a variable, method, or class.

## ðŸ“Œ 1. `final` Variable

### ðŸ”¹ Meaning:
- A variable declared `final` can be **assigned only once**.
- After it's initialized, its **value cannot be changed**.

### ðŸ”¹ Where Itâ€™s Used:
- Constants (e.g., mathematical values like PI)
- Configuration values
- Read-only fields

### ðŸ”¹ Types of Final Variables:
- **Instance variables**: Declared final to ensure they donâ€™t change once initialized.
- **Static final variables**: Treated as constants; usually declared at the class level.
- **Local variables**: Used in methods; often needed when using inner classes or lambdas.

### ðŸ”¹ If Not Used:
- Variables can be unintentionally modified, which can lead to bugs, especially in multithreaded environments or when shared across components.

## ðŸ“Œ 2. `final` Method

### ðŸ”¹ Meaning:
- A method marked `final` **cannot be overridden** in subclasses.

### ðŸ”¹ Where Itâ€™s Used:
- To **preserve behavior** in the base class that should not be changed.
- Ensures **security or consistency** in critical logic.
- Often used in frameworks to protect internal logic from being overridden by client code.

### ðŸ”¹ If Not Used:
- Subclasses might override the method and introduce **inconsistent or unwanted behavior**.

## ðŸ“Œ 3. `final` Class

### ðŸ”¹ Meaning:
- A class declared `final` **cannot be extended or inherited**.

### ðŸ”¹ Where Itâ€™s Used:
- When you want to **prevent subclassing** for security, design, or performance reasons.
- Ensures that the class's behavior stays consistent and **cannot be altered** through inheritance.
- Common with utility classes and core system classes (like in the Java standard library).

### ðŸ”¹ If Not Used:
- Developers could subclass and possibly **misuse or incorrectly extend** the logic.

|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `final` variable | Like a **sealed envelope** â€” once closed, you can't change the contents |
| `final` method   | Like a **fixed rule** in a game â€” you can't make your own version of it |
| `final` class    | Like a **non-modifiable machine** â€” you can use it, but can't alter it |

## ðŸŽ¯ Why Use `final`?

- Improves **code safety and clarity**
- Prevents **accidental changes**
- Enforces **design intentions**
- Makes code **easier to maintain and debug**
- Optimizes performance in some cases (the JVM can optimize better knowing some things wonâ€™t change)
